This bot is untested AND uses untested functions (specifically, adding/removing liquidity) from the [botiq library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botiq)- which is also being develped by me.

To use, copy the contents of config-template.tml into a new file called config.tml and fill out with your details.
You will need your wallet's private key and a json rpc endpoint into ethereum (I use [ANKR](https://www.ankr.com/) - it's free. I detail how to get an appropriate URL in the docs of [an old project](https://github.com/neauangle/botchi/blob/master/documentation.pdf) under Getting a Blockchain API). 

Once it's been tested I can wrap it all up as a standalone executable. As of writing this, it hasn't been tested even once because
I have about $5 spare USDC ðŸ¤· these things take time.

Use at your own risk.
