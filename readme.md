This bot is untested AND uses untested functions (adding/removing liquidity) from the botiq library- which is also being develped by me.

To use, copy the contents of config-template.tml into a new file called config.tml and fill out with your details.
You will need your wallet's private key and a json rpc endpoint into ethereum (I use ANKR - https://www.ankr.com/ - it's free). 

Use at your own risk.
